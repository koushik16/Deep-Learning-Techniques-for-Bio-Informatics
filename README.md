# Deep Learning Techniques in Bioinformatics 

Hey there! This repository contains all the work I've done for a grad course. Here, I'm documenting my journey through the different classic and advanced machine learning techniques we've learned to solve biological problems.

## Course Overview

This course was all about applying machine learning to analyze biological data, which can be really noisy and uncertain. We covered both foundational techniques like Naive Bayes, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks, as well as newer deep learning methods that are making waves in biology. The focus was on using these methods to solve some tough biological problems.

We also explored probabilistic models, including Markov Models, Hidden Markov Models, and Bayesian Networks, to work on biological sequence analysis and systems biology. It was a great mix of theory, coding, and actually applying ML to real-world biological data.

Here's what you'll find in this repo:

1. **Classic Machine Learning Techniques**: Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Neural Networks. These aimed to apply classic ML models to biological data, showing how they handle data noise and generalize from patterns.

2. **Deep Learning for Bioinformatics**: Worked on applying deep learning approaches to some challenging biological datasets, exploring their strengths in modeling complex relationships.

3. **Probabilistic Models for Biological Sequences**: Implemented Markov Models, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), and Bayesian Networks for analyzing biological sequences. These models are great for dealing with sequential data and understanding relationships in systems biology.

## Objectives

This repo is meant to be useful for both biologists/bioinformatics folks and people coming from a computational background:

- **For biologists**: You'll get a feel for how we formulate biological problems computationally and the ML models that help solve them.
- **For computational people**: You'll get a glimpse into some of the fascinating biological problems that are ripe for ML solutions.
- **For everyone**: This course helped me understand the unique challenges of bioinformatics, implement some simple ML solutions myself, and use Python (scikit-learn) and R packages to apply these techniques to real data.

## Future Work

This repository will continue to grow as I explore more topics in deep learning and bioinformatics. I'll keep adding new projects, improvements, and experiments, so stay tuned for updates!
